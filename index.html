            <p>She said "I'll throw myself away<br>
                They're just photos after all"<br>
                I can't make you hang around<br>
                I can't wash you off my skin<br>
                Outside the frame, is what we're leaving out<br>
                You won't remember anyway</p>
            <p>I can go with the flow<br>
                But don't say it doesn't matter, matter anymore<br>
                I can go with the flow<br>
                Do you believe it in your head?<br>
            </p>
            <p>It's so safe to play along<br>
                Little soldiers in a row<br>
                Falling in and out of love<br>
                With something sweet to throw away<br>
            </p>

            <p>But I want something good to die for<br>
                To make it beautiful to live.<br>
                I want a new mistake, lose is more than hesitate.<br>
                Do you believe it in your head?
